/*+-One of the Many Improvements to SASS vs CSS is the Way in which the Sub-Element of an Element is Accessed in order to Stylize it. For example, if in CSS we want to change the Background Color of the 
        Element <a> inside the Element <h3> of an Element <footer>, we would have to write this:_
        
        footer {
            background-color: cyan;
        }
        footer h3{
            color: blue;
        }
        footer h3 a{
            color: green;
        }
        
        +-But with sass it is much simpler; We just have to nest The Sub Element Inside the Brackets of its Parent Element, like this:_
        
        footer {
            background-color: cyan;
            h3{
                color: blue;
                a{
                    color: green;
                }Â 
            }
        }

        And to apply and save the changes, we open the VS Code Terminal and enter this Code:_  sass --watch sass:css
        And then Save.
